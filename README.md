I used React Vite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create my first MERN website, "Waagn Bi," which focuses on cooking. The site features a responsive design, ensuring it works seamlessly on various devices.

The CSS styling provides a timeless and subtle aesthetic with a white, cream, and brown hues palette. The website includes five main components: a versatile Navbar, a captivating Jumbotron, beautiful cards, intuitive modals, and containers.

There are six primary pages: the homepage, sign-up/login, food recipes, science insights, tips, and an Error 404 page. The homepage serves as a recipe hub, featuring a dynamic search functionality that allows users to explore various recipes by entering keywords like "chicken" or "pie." Each recipe is fetched via an API and displayed within cards, showing details such as origin, category, ingredients, and cooking instructions when selected.

The tips page offers a wealth of culinary wisdom through engaging articles, while the food science section explores the nutritional benefits of different foods. Authentication is securely handled through a backend developed with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js, ensuring safe storage and verification of user data.

This MERN project showcases my technical skills and ignites my passion for continuous improvement. As I continue my programming journey, I am committed to refining and expanding this project to provide an even more enriching user experience.
